Day 16: Practicebot in the Making

We continued our consistent efforts with building the robot and are working on different components.  Last Thursday we decided that we wanted to start working on Practicebot. We just finished welding the frame for it. We have students trying to put the shooter together so that we will be able to test the new shooter with Protobot's chassis.  In addition to working on the shooter for Practicebot, we have been currently trying to test out the intake and make minor changes to try and make the intake as efficient as possible.  The programming committee struggled a little throughout the day but most of the debugging was done by the time lunch started.  By the end of the day we had started to weld the chassis for the robot and plan out the layout for our electrical board.
